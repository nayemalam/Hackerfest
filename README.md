# Hackerfest-Challenge
Hackerfest challenge with FormFintech Startup - creating a web scraper that pulls 5 major bank's chequing information

The following script pulls information from the chequings plans for each of the banks: 

- BMO
- RBC
- TD
- Scotia Bank
- CIBC

<strong>Context:</strong>
As part of Startupfest - hackerfest invites multiple startups who are looking for enthusiastic and ambitious individuals looking to make an impact. 

The first day, I introduced myself to every startup and finally decided to pick <a href="https://www.formfintech.com/">FormFintech</a> where they were looking for a software dev.

I never did scraping ever so I took the night to learn how to scrape information and what packages to use.
The next day, I made a ready version of the scraper.

Feel free to look through my code and ask me any questions you might have.
